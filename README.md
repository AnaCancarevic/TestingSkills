Here you will find automated tests for different public web pages.
All java classes in tests package extend BaseTest. (as in ProbnaKlasaTest)
BaseTest will start Chrome before each test and close it after.

Each page/helper class should extends BaseHelper.

Download appropriate version for your chrome :
Chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) 
It should be downloaded and extracted to root (next to pom.xml).
